I am currently working as a research assistant with Professor [Lee Fleming](https://funginstitute.berkeley.edu/people/lee-fleming/) at UC Berkeley, in a project that focuses on utilizing deep learning models to analyze US patent data and tackle the challenge of name disambiguation. Prior to this, I earned my Master of Analytics degree from UC Berkeley, and I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool. 

My research passion primarily revolves around deep reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on multi-agent systems. Additionally, I have a keen interest in computational social science, where I explore the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address societal challenges. For more detailed information, feel free to explore my [research page](/research)! I am actively seeking a PhD position starting either in the fall of 2024 or the spring of 2025. If my research aligns with your interests, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to potential collaborations!

<!-- My research passion, in general, revolves around the transformation of data into practical solutions using robust deep learning and reinforcement learning models. These models can be applied to address various challenges in fields such as engineering, business, social science, and more. Please visit my research page for further information. I am always open to having a coffee chat to discuss diverse research ideas and exchange insights ☕️. -->

<!-- I am currently engaged in an affiliate research position, with Professor Lee Fleming as my supervisor at UC Berkeley. In this role, I am actively involved in a project that focuses utilizing deep learning models to analyze extensive US patent data for valuable insights derived from big data (explore our work here!).Prior to this, I earned my Master of Analytics degree from UC Berkeley, and I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool.

I believe big data has the huge potential to create significant impacts in fields like science, arts and society at large, particularly when combined with effective data mining and analytics. My research passion lies in capturing the potential of this expansive data to construct robust machine learning and deep learning models. These models, in turn, offer viable solutions to address practical challenges in egineering, business and social sciences etc.

I also appreciate the intelligent mechanism that forms the foundation of reinforcement learning methods, which facilitates agents learning dynamically and interactively with the environment by trial and error. Specifically, I am interested in utilizing RL methods tackle cooperative and coordination tasks within multi-agent systems. (see my undergraduate thesis on this topic here!)

I am seeking a PhD position starting from 2024 fall or 2025 Spring. If my profile aligns with your interests, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at peng_zheng@berkeley.edu or irenezheng0227@gmail.com if you are interested in my profile!  -->

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
