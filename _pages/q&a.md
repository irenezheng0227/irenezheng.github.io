Why do you aspire to pursue a Ph.D.?
======

A short answer is that I have a deep passion for research, and aim to refine my skills as a professional researcher during my PhD journey. Specifically, I love the dynamic when I'm doing research, as it summons a distinct aspect of myself - one that is more focused, and motivated with a sense of joy. Furthermore, I am constantly engaging in learning state-of-art research and strive to generate innovative ideas. Thus, I aspire to establish my career in the realm of research, and embarking on a Ph.D. is the best way to get started on this journey. In addition, I love teaching and have a strong desire to connect with people, particularly through interactions with students. Therefore, the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant, leading labs or even lectures, holds significant importance and interest for me.


Do you have other hobbies aside from your research?
======

I love traveling. I enjoy photography, learning about new cultures and making friends during each journey. So far, my favorite spot has been Albert Dock in Liverpool, United Kingdom! I'm also a music lover. I started learning piano at a very young age, around 5 years old. I used to write songs when I was a teenager, though not anymore unfortunately. I often read and watch movies when I have some free time. The most recent book I'm reading is 'Normal People.' The most impressive movie for me this year is 'Oppenheimer', with some scenes shot at Berkeley!
